## Random Tune Bot

Random Tune Bot is a twitter bot that tweets a random tune from top submissions on subreddits such as /r/Music, /r/listentothis, /r/hiphopheads, scraping only the youtube links, in 4 hour intervals. It saves the tune that is tweeted in a local json file that is being used a database to avoid duplicate tunes.
